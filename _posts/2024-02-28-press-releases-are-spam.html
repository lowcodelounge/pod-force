<p>Kimberly sits down with Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson to discuss a chapter from <a href='https://basecamp.com/books/rework'><em>REWORK</em></a> titled “Press Releases Are Spam,” explaining why traditional press releases don&apos;t work well for their product launches. The conversation touches on the shift from formal press releases to direct-to-consumer approaches in today’s media scene. They touch upon the importance of hearing from authentic voices with skin in the game rather than relying on formulaic press releases.
