<p>Hetty Green bailed out New York City. Her decisions on what interest rates to charge moved markets and were reported in major newspapers. She was a one woman bank and the single biggest individual financier in the world. She took no partners and ran her own money. She built a financial empire of stocks, bonds, railroads, and real estate. She battled the great men of her day and kept a gun on her desk. She did all of this alone. Defiantly independent and ferociously intelligent she built a vast, liquid fortune at a time when women couldn't even vote. She used her intelligence to increase her wealth, her independence to live as she wished, and her strength to battle anyone who stood in her way.</p><p>This episode is what I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/4j1sHJD">Hetty: The Genius and Madness of America’s First Female Tycoon</a> by Charles Slack and <a href="https://amzn.to/3W6kfiC">The Richest Woman in America: Hetty Green in the Gilded Age</a> by Janet Wallach. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.
