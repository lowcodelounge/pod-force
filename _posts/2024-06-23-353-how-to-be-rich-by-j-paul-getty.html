(Founders #212) </p><p>(12:00) Control as much of your business as possible. You don’t want to have to worry about what is going on in the other guy’s shop.</p><p>(20:00) Optimism is a moral duty. Pessimism aborts opportunity.</p><p>(21:00) I studied the lives of great men and women. And I found that the men and women who got to the top were those who did the jobs they had in hand, with everything they had of energy and enthusiasm and hard work.</p><p>(22:00) 98 percent of our attention was devoted to the task at hand. We are believers in Carlyle's Prescription, that the job a man is to do is the job at hand and not see what lies dimly in the distance. — Charlie Munger</p><p>(27:00) Entrepreneurs want to create their own security.</p><p>(34:00) Example is the best means to instruct or inspire others.</p><p>(37:00) Long orders, which require much time to prepare, to read and to understand are the enemies of speed.

It’s all about the long term. You should keep a fortress of cash, reinvest in your business, and use debt sparingly. Doing so will help you survive to reap the long-term benefits of your business.</p><p>(54:00) You’ll go much farther if you stop trying to look and act and think like everyone else.</p><p>(55:00) The line that divides majority opinion from mass hysteria is often so fine as to be virtually invisible.</p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
