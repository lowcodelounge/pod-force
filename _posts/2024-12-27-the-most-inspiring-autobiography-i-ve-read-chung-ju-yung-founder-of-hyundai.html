<p>Chung Ju-yung grew up so poor he had to eat tree bark to survive. He founded Hyundai and became the richest person in Korea. When Chung was in his 80s, he wrote an autobiography that tells the devastating reality of growing up in dire poverty, how he escaped through manual labor, and how he founded and grew one of the world's largest conglomerates. Along the way he shares advice like why you should emulate bedbugs, the importance of going where the money is, and why people called him "The Bulldozer."</p><p>This episode is what I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3VYumFR">Born of This Land: My Life Story </a>by Chung Ju-yung.</p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.
