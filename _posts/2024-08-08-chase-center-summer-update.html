Two items for this “mini-episode”:</p><ol><li>Tickets are<strong> </strong><a href="http://acquired.fm/sf"><strong>now available</strong></a> for our live show at Chase Center in San Francisco, with special guests including Mark Zuckerberg (!). The show is Tuesday, September 10th, with doors opening at 5 PM for an hour of mingling with other listeners before the show starts at 6 PM. Huge thank you to the J.P. Morgan Payments team for being our incredible partner in making this happen. Tickets are almost gone so make sure you grab one ASAP — you don’t want to miss this night! <a href="https://acquired.fm/sf">https://acquired.fm/sf</a><p></p></li><li>We also figured this is a good excuse to update you all on the state of Acquired — after an incredible first half of the year (including <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/acquired-podcast-tech-business-history-strategy-90e73603">WSJ’s profile of the show</a>) we are taking the rest of the summer off to recharge, parent our young children, and prepare for the big night in September.
