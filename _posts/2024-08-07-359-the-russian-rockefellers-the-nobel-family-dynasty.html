<p>The name of Nobel usually calls to mind Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite, and the internationally prestigious prizes that bear his name. But Alfred was only one member of a creative and innovative family who built an industrial empire in prerevolutionary Russia. The saga begins with an emigre from Sweden, Immanuel Nobel, who was an architect, a pioneer producer of steam engines, and a maker of weapons.</p><p>Immanuel's sons included Alfred; Robert, who directed the family's activities in the Caspian oil fields; and Ludwig, an engineering genius and manufacturing magnate whose boundless energy and fierce determination created the Russian petroleum industry.</p><p>Ludwig's son Emanuel showed similar mettle, shrewdly bargaining with the Rothschilds for control of the Russian markets and competing head-on with Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell for lucrative world markets.</p><p>Perhaps no family in history has played so decisive a role in building an industrial empire in an underdeveloped but resource-rich nation. Yet the achievements of the Nobel family have been largely forgotten. When the Bolsheviks came to power, Emmanuel had to flee the country disguised as a peasant.</p><p>The Nobel empire with its 50,000 workers lay in ruins. An empire which had taken eighty years to design and build, was nearly destroyed, bringing a sudden and bitter end to one of the most remarkable industrial odysseys in world history.</p><p>This episode is what I learned from reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3yFNY9j">The Russian Rockefellers: The Saga of the Nobel Family and the Russian Oil Industry</a> by Robert Tolf.</p><p>----</p><p>Make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud <a href="https://ramp.com/">by going to Ramp and learning how they can help your business control your costs and save more</a>. </p><p>----</p><p>Founders Notes gives you the superpower to learn from history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand.
