I live by those words. <br /><br />To this day, I don't enjoy working. I enjoy playing, and figuring out how to connect playing with business. To me, that's my niche. People talk about my work ethic as a player, but they don't understand. What appeared to be hard work to others was simply playing for me.</p><p>You have to be uncompromised in your level of commitment to whatever you are doing, or it can disappear as fast as it appeared. <br /><br />Look around, just about any person or entity achieving at a high level has the same focus. The morning after Tiger Woods rallied to beat Phil Mickelson at the Ford Championship in 2005, he was in the gym by 6:30 to work out. No lights. No cameras. No glitz or glamour. Uncompromised. <br /><br />I knew going against the grain was just part of the process.</p><p>The mind will play tricks on you. The mind was telling you that you couldn't go any further. The mind was telling you how much it hurt. The mind was telling you these things to keep you from reaching your goal. But you have to see past that, turn it all off if you are going to get where you want to be.<br /><br />I would wake up in the morning thinking: How am I going to attack today?<br /><br />I’m not so dominant that I can’t listen to creative ideas coming from other people. Successful people listen. Those who don’t listen, don’t survive long.<br /><br />In all honesty, I don't know what's ahead. If you ask me what I'm going to do in five years, I can't tell you. This moment? Now that's a different story. I know what I'm doing moment to moment, but I have no idea what's ahead. I'm so connected to this moment that I don't make assumptions about what might come next, because I don't want to lose touch with the present. Once you make assumptions about something that might happen, or might not happen, you start limiting the potential outcomes. </p><p>----</p><p><a href="http://www.foundersnotes.com/">Get access to the World’s Most Valuable Notebook for Founders</a></p><p>You can read, reread, and search all my notes and highlights from every book I've ever read for the podcast. </p><p>You can also ask SAGE any question and SAGE will read all my notes, highlights, and every transcript from every episode for you.</p><p> A few questions I've asked SAGE recently: </p><p>What are the most important leadership lessons from history's greatest entrepreneurs?</p><p>Can you give me a summary of Warren Buffett's best ideas?
