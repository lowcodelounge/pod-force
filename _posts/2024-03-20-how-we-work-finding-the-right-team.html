<p>37signals is hiring! However, the traditional resume and formal education credentials don’t rank as high as you might think in their hiring process.<br/><br/>In this episode of The Rework Podcast, host Kimberly Rhodes chats with co-founders of 37signals, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson about reviewing potential job candidates. You’ll hear them discuss why a personalized cover letter can tell a lot more about a potential hire than chronological work history, and why AI isn’t always a dependable author for those details.</p><p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p><p>00:45 - Resumes are basically piles of lies</p><p>02:27 - Cover letters should explain why you want the job</p><p>05:07 - Test driving final candidates</p><p>11:05 - Jason and David’s involvement in the hiring process</p><p>18:59 - Finding employees that are the right cultural fit<br/><br/>Rework is a production of 37signals. You can find show notes and transcripts on our website. Full video episodes are available on YouTube and X.</p><p>If you have a question for Jason or David about a better way to work and run your business, leave us a voicemail at 708-628-7850 or email rework@37signals.com, and we might answer it on a future episode. </p><p><b>Links and Resources:</b></p><p><a href='https://37signals.com/books'><b>Books by 37signals</b></a></p><p><a href='https://basecamp.com/pricing'><b>Sign up for a 30-day free trial at Basecamp.com</b></a></p><p><a href='https://www.hey.com/world/'><b>HEY World | HEY</b></a><b> </b></p><p><a href='https://www.rework.fm/'><b><em>The REWORK podcast</em></b></a></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@37signals/podcasts'><b>The Rework Podcast on YouTube</b></a></p><p><a href='https://dev.37signals.com/'><b>The 37signals Dev Blog</b></a></p><p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/basecamp/featured'><b>37signals on YouTube</b></a></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/37signals'><b>@37signals on X</b></a><b> </b></p>
