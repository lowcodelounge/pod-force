<p>I sent a friend this text: I'm working on another Li Lu episode but this one is about his remarkable investing career. Can be summarized by: 1. Studied Buffett and Munger. 2. Did that. Last episode was about how Li Lu survived one of the most horrific childhoods imaginable. This episode covers how he thinks about investing and entrepreneurship—in his own words. </p><p>Sources: </p><p><a href="https://www.rbcpa.com/commentary-archive/li-lus-foreword-to-poor-charlies-almanack-the-wit-and-wisdom-of-charles-t-munger/">The forward to the Chinese edition of  Poor Charlie’s Almanack written by Li Lu </a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-jF5au0-JiY?si=4OFG1pMtuCP8HOfN">Li Lu's Colombia Business School lecture 2006</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/_BasYrkoixU?si=jirUbuxNf37QjC_l">Li Lu’s San Francisco State University lecture 2012</a></p><p><a href="https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/imce-uploads/Graham%20%26%20Doddsville%20-%20Issue%2018%20-%20Spring%202013_0.pdf">Graham & Doddsville interview with Li Lu </a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QqXLF1HNtd4?si=BlMyZVHGFy69V3lb"><strong>13th Colombia Business Conference 2021</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/li-lus-reflections-reaching-fifty/"><strong>Li Lu's Reflections On Reaching Fifty</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>----</p><p><a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.
