Rockefeller Sr. My comment was that comparing me to John D. Sr. was like comparing a sparrow to an eagle. My words were not inspired by modesty, but by facts.</p><p>(8:00) On his dad sending him to military school: The strict, regimented environment was good for me.</p><p>(20:00) Entrepreneurs are people whose mind and energies are constantly being used at peak capacity.</p><p>(28:00) Advice for fellow entrepreneurs: Don’t be like William Randolph Hearst. Reinvest in your business. Keep a fortress of cash. Use debt sparingly.</p><p>(30:00) The great entrepreneurs I know have these traits:</p><p>-Devoted their minds and energy to building productive enterprises (over the long term)</p><p>-They concentrated on expanding</p><p>-They concentrated on making their companies more efficient </p><p>-They reinvest heavily in to their business (which can help efficiency and expansion )</p><p>-Always personally involved in their business</p><p>-They know their business down to the ground</p><p>-They have an innate capacity to think on a large scale</p><p>(34:00) Five wives can't all be wrong.

I was drilling several wells and it was by no means uncommon for me to stay on the sites overnight or even for two days or more.</p><p>(38:00) A hatred of failure has always been part of my nature and one of the more pronounced motivating forces in my life.  Once I have committed myself to any undertaking, a powerful inner drive cuts in and I become intent on seeing it through to a satisfactory conclusion.</p><p>(38:00) My own nature is such that I am able to concentrate on whatever is before me and am not easily distracted from it.</p><p>(42:00) There are times when certain cards sit unclaimed in the common pile, when certain properties become available that will never be available again. A good businessman feels these moments like a fall in the barometric pressure. A great businessman is dumb enough to act on them even when he cannot afford to. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3yzKVwI">The Fish That Ate the Whale: The Life and Times of America's Banana King</a> by Rich Cohen.
