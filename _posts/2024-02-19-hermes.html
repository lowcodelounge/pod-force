<p>In luxury, there’s Hermès… and there’s everyone else. Stewarded by one French family over six generations, Hermès sells the absolute pinnacle of the French luxury dream. Loyal clients will wait <em>years</em> simply for the opportunity to buy one of the company’s flagship Birkin or Kelly bags. Unlike every other luxury brand, Hermès:</p><ul><li>Doesn’t increase supply to meet demand (hence the waitlists)</li><li>Doesn’t loudly brand their products (IYKYK)</li><li>Doesn’t do celebrity endorsements (stars buy their bags just like everyone else)</li><li>Doesn’t even have a marketing department! (they barely advertise at all)</li></ul><p>And yet everyone knows who they are and what they represent. But, despite all their iconoclasm, this is not a company that’s stood still for six generations. Unbeknownst to most, Hermès has completely reinvented itself at least three times in its 187-year history. Including most recently (and most dramatically) by the family’s current leaders, who responded to LVMH and Bernard Arnault’s 2010 takeover attempt by pursuing a radical strategy — scaling hand craftsmanship. And in the process they turned the company from a sleepy, ~$10B family enterprise into a $200B market cap European giant. Tune in for one incredible story!</p><p></p><p><strong>Sponsors:<br></strong><br>ServiceNow: <a href="https://bit.ly/acqsnaiagents">https://bit.ly/acqsnaiagents</a><br>Huntress: <a href="https://bit.ly/acqhuntress">https://bit.ly/acqhuntress</a><br>Vanta: <a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredvanta">https://bit.ly/acquiredvanta</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>More Acquired!:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/email">Get email updates</a> with hints on next episode and follow-ups from recent episodes</li><li><a href="http://acquired.fm/slack">Join the Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://pod.link/acquiredlp">Subscribe to ACQ2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/store">Merch Store</a>!</li></ul><p>© Copyright 2015-2024 ACQ, LLC</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/hermes">See our episode page for visuals!</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/g6HOhqaVXW0?si=rdX6cEfgMQpWo31g">The saddle stitch (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thedashingrider.com/hermes-inside-the-saddlery/">Inside the Saddlery at the Faubourg</a></li><li><a href="https://assets-finance.hermes.com/s3fs-public/node/pdf_file/2023-05/1684143348/hermes-urd-2022-en_01.pdf">Hermès 2022 Annual Report</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htlh8IpER5g">Axel Dumas Interview</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13S39Z-7vF4WE8jbFJq_uK3aR-YDV84oBKK-w1cVUi3o/edit?usp=sharing">All episode sources</a></li></ul><p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0C4DGBHY2">Anker GaN Prime 100W charger</a></li><li><a href="https://hq.getmatter.com">Matter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Score-Takes-Care-Itself-Philosophy/dp/1591843472">The Score Takes Care of Itself</a></li></ul><p><em>‍Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.
