With the advent of the silicon chip, information processing, and communications, the national economy have been strikingly altered. The new technology is changing how we live, how we work, how we think. The revolution didn't just happen; it was engineered by a small number of people. Collectively, they engineered Tomorrow. Foremost among them is Robert Noyce.</p><p>(2:00) Steve Jobs on Robert Noyce: “He was one of the giants in this valley who provided the model and inspiration for everything we wanted to become. He was the ultimate inventor. The ultimate rebel. The ultimate entrepreneur.”</p><p>(4:00) When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.  — <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">How To Do Great Work</a> by Paul Graham. (Founders #314)</p><p>(7:00) Bob Noyce had a passion for the scientific grind.</p><p>(10:00) He had a profound and baffling self-confidence.</p><p>(15:00) They called Shockley’s personalty reverse charisma. —  <a href="https://amzn.to/3akXTkI">Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age</a> by Joel Shurkin. (Founders #165)</p><p>(25:00) What the beginning of an industry looks like: Anywhere from 50 to 90% of the transistors produced would turn out to be defective.</p><p>(33:00) Young engineers were giving themselves over to a new technology as if it were a religious mission.</p><p>(41:00) Noyce's idea was that every employee should feel that he could go as far and as fast in this industry as his talent would take him. He didn't want any employee to look at the structure of Intel and see a complex set of hurdles.</p><p>(43:00) This wasn't a corporation. It was a congregation.</p><p>(43:00) There were sermons. At Intel everyone, Noyce included, was expected to attend sessions on "the Intel Culture." At these sessions the principles by which the company was run were spelled out and discussed.</p><p>(45:00) If you're ambitious and hardworking, you want to be told how you're doing.</p><p>(45:00) In Noyce's view, most of the young hotshots who were coming to work for Intel had never had the benefit of honest grades in their lives. In the late 1960s and early 1970s college faculties had been under pressure to give all students passing marks so they wouldn't have to go off to Vietnam, and they had caved in, until the entire grading system was meaningless. At Intel they would learn what measuring up meant.</p><p>(49:00) When you are trying to convince an audience to accept a radical innovation, almost by definition the idea is so far from the status quo that many people simply cannot get their minds around it. They quickly discovered that the marketplace wasn’t just confused by the concept of the microprocessor, but was actually frightened by its implications. Many of my engineering friends scoffed at it was a gimmick. Their solution? The market had to be educated. At one point, Intel was conducting more seminars and workshops on how to use the microprocessor than the local junior collage’s total catalog of courses. Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove became part of a traveling educational roadshow. Everyone who could walk and talk became educators. It worked.  —  <a href="https://amzn.to/4cWr4cp">The Intel Trinity: How Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove Built the World's Most Important Company </a>by Michael Malone. </p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
