<p>Mark is <strong><em>the</em></strong> iconic founder CEO of our time. At Chase Center on September 10, 2024, he did an unprecedented thing: a live conversation in front of 6,000 people on Meta’s company strategy, sharing stories from early Facebook history, and his thoughts on the future of AI, VR, and AR. Mark was remarkably candid in our discussion, and gave us a window into his real and intense daily demeanor leading Meta. (And his other life endeavors!)</p><p>We can't wait to release the <em>complete</em> video of the whole night, including our surprise conversations with Daniel Ek, Emily Chang, and cameo appearances from Jensen Huang and Mike Taylor (the incredible singer of “Who Got the Truth?”). That’s coming in a couple weeks, but for now: enjoy this conversation with Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p><p>Many thanks to our fantastic Fall ‘24 Season partners:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredJPMPF241pod">J.P.
