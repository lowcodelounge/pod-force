<p>Here it is: the complete video of the most unbelievable night of Acquired’s nine-year life… our sold out live show at the Chase Center in San Francisco. We joked during the months (months!) of preparation leading up to this event that it was like planning a wedding for 6,000 Acquired fans, and the guest list included Jamie Dimon, Daniel Ek, Emily Chang, Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg… no pressure! But thanks to our amazing partnership with J.P. Morgan Payments, together we were able to make something incredible. Tune in and enjoy the celebration!</p><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p><p>Many thanks to our fantastic Fall ‘24 Season partners:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/acquiredJPMPF242pod">J.P.
