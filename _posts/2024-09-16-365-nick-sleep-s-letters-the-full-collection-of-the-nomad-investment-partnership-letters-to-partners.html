<p>The best investors are not investors at all. They're entrepreneurs who have never sold. — Nick Sleep</p><p>Nick Sleep’s letters are a masterclass on the importance of understanding the underlying reality of a business — what he calls the engine of its success.</p><p>I read all 110,000 words of Nick’s letters (twice!) to make this episode and what I found most important is Nick’s ability to develop a deep understanding of “honestly run compounding machines” (like Costco and Amazon) years before everyone else.</p><p>Nick explains clearly how Jim Sinegal and Jeff Bezos set up their companies for long term success —from the very beginning — and gives us a few hints along the way on how we can do the same in our business.</p><p>And the absolute entrepreneurial history nerd in me loved the references to Henry Ford, Sam Walton, Rockefeller and other greats from the past that are sprinkled throughout Nick’s letters.</p><p>No surprise that someone who was able to make $2 billion for his clients has a deep understanding of the great work that came before him.</p><p><a href="https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf">If you want to read all of Nick Sleep’s partnership letters you can do so here for free</a></p><p>You can also read William Green’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/3AWwOoJ">Richer, Wiser, Happier: How The World's Greatest Investors Win In Markets and Life</a> —which both Nick and I recommend.
