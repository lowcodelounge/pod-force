IKEA will offer a wide range of well-designed furniture at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.</p><p>Billy Durant (founder of General Motors) describing Henry Ford’s one single idea: Durant noted that Ford “was in favor of keeping prices down to the lowest possible point, giving to the multitude the benefit of cheap transportation.” — <a href="https://amzn.to/48IH9Br">Billy Durant: Creator of General Motors</a> by Lawrence Gustin </p><p>Something Ingvar repeats: We will do it a different way.</p><p>This will not be easy. We must demand much from ourselves.</p><p>IKEA must have low prices. Ingvar’s dedication to that idea is total. Without low costs we can never accomplish our purpose. The principle can never be compromised: Our policy of serving the many can never be changed.</p><p>If you are not enthusiastic about your job, one-third of your life goes to waste.</p><p>Wasting resources is a mortal sin at IKEA.</p><p>Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of mediocrity.</p><p>Planning is often synonymous with bureaucracy. Exaggerated planning is the most common cause of corporate death.</p><p>Simple routines have a greater impact. Simplicity in our behavior gives us strength.</p><p>No reports. No committees. Just done. — Elon in the early days of SpaceX <a href="https://amzn.to/36nCdGk">Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX</a> by Eric Berger. (Founders #369) </p><p>We dare to do things differently.</p><p>You had to remember he'd been picking up the best ideas from all around the country. — <a href="https://amzn.to/3hNAnBX">Copy This!: How I turned Dyslexia, ADHD, and 100 square feet into a company called Kinkos</a> by Paul Orfalea. (Founders #181) </p><p>Concentration is important to our success. The general who divides his resources will invariably be defeated.</p><p>We can never do everything, everywhere, all at the same time.</p><p>We must concentrate for maximum impact, often with small means.</p><p>Concentration means that at certain vital stages we are forced to neglect otherwise important aspects.</p><p>Constant meetings and group discussions are often the result of unwillingness or inability on the part of the person in charge to make decisions.</p><p>Only those who are asleep make no mistakes. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active.</p><p>The fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development.</p><p>It is always the mediocre people who are negative, who spend their time proving that they were not wrong. The strong person is always positive and looks forward.</p><p>Happiness is not reaching your goal. Happiness is being on the way. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning (He said this when he was already 33 years into running his company!)</p><p>Bear in mind that time is your most important resource. You can do so much in ten minutes. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. You can never get them back. Divide your life into ten-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.</p><p>Let us continue to be a group of positive fanatics who stubbornly and persistently refuse to accept the impossible.</p><p>Ingvar’s family had to rent out all the rooms in their house to strangers to make ends meet.</p><p>Selling things became an obsession. Trading was in my blood.</p><p>By 1997 IKEA had mailed out over 100 million catalogs.</p><p>Ingvar was the first person in the furniture industry to combine a mail order catalog and a furniture store.</p><p>Cost awareness was to be IKEA’s anthem.</p><p>Ingvar’s greatest regret was working so much that he missed out on seeing his 3 son’s grow up: Childhood does not allow itself to be reconquered.</p><p>I have not been able to avoid severe losses. Both fiascoes and triumphs have marked the history of the business.</p><p>Ingvar would rather his employees make mistakes than be idle.</p><p>The wave Ingvar rode: Sweden’s housing construction boom. More than 1 million new apartments were built after the war. All of them needed well designed, affordable furniture. </p><p>The way IKEA was described by its competitors: A monster with seven heads: “If you cut off one, another soon grows.”</p><p>A golden rule of IKEA: Regard every problem as a possibility. The boycott by the National Association of Furniture Dealers was the best thing that ever happened to IKEA. It forced IKEA down a path of product differentiation and helped them stumble upon the idea of flat packing and self assembled furniture.</p><p>The laws of IKEA since birth:  </p><p>-A good cash reserve must always be ensured.</p><p>-All property must be owned.</p><p>-All expansion is to be largely self-financed.</p><p>-There shall be no boasting.</p><p>We push cost awareness at all levels with almost manic frenzy.</p><p>Ingvar believes in the ability to wait out difficulties.</p><p>Ingvar believes in gathering unfiltered intel from the front lines. He makes unannounced store visits and spends time talking to the employees unloading furniture and helping customers.</p><p>The day he is free of IKEA life for him will no longer be worth living. He loves it, aways wants to lie as close as possible to it, and never tires of improving it.</p><p>A demon in me says I have so much to do. I am never satisfied. Something tells me what I’m doing at the moment has to be done better tomorrow.</p><p>Behind this multinational tycoon is a country boy with a fierce sense of being an underdog.</p><p>He has a peasants distrust of a favorable destiny that keeps his feet on the ground.</p><p>----</p><p>“<i>I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out. The only criticism I would have is that after each podcast I usually want to buy the book because I am interested so my poor wallet suffers</i>. ” — Gareth</p><p>Be like Gareth.
